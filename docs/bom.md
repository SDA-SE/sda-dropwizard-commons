Gradle define a mechanism that developers can leverage to align the versions of
dependencies that belong to the same framework, or an umbrella of dependencies that need to be
aligned to work well together. Using them will prevent version conflicts and aide you figure out
which dependency versions work well with each other. This mechanism is called  **Bill of Materials (BOM).**

The module `sda-commons-bom` defines the versions of sda-commons modules.
