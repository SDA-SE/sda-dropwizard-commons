# SDA Commons Server Prometheus

[![javadoc](https://javadoc.io/badge2/org.sdase.commons/sda-commons-server-prometheus/javadoc.svg)](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.sdase.commons/sda-commons-server-prometheus)

The module `sda-commons-server-prometheus` provides an admin endpoint to serve metrics and health check results in a format that Prometheus can read. 
The endpoint is available at the applications admin port at `/metrics/prometheus`.

## Provided metrics

## Health Checks

All health checks are provided as a Gauge metric `healthcheck_status` and are included in the metrics endpoint.
They are also available at the applications admin port at `/healthcheck/prometheus`.
This endpoint is only available for backward compatibility and will be removed in the future.
The name of the Health Check is used as label `name`.
The metric value is `1.0` for healthy and `0.0` for unhealthy. Example:

```
healthcheck_status{name="hibernate",} 1.0
healthcheck_status{name="disk_space",} 0.0
```

Currently, health checks are evaluated when their status is requested. Slow health checks should be annotated with 
[`com.codahale.metrics.health.annotation.Async`](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/blob/v4.0.2/metrics-healthchecks/src/main/java/com/codahale/metrics/health/annotation/Async.java)
to avoid blocking collection of the results.

## Usage

The [`PrometheusBundle`](https://github.com/SDA-SE/sda-dropwizard-commons/tree/main/sda-commons-server-prometheus/src/main/java/org/sdase/commons/server/prometheus/PrometheusBundle.java) has to be added in
the application:

```java
import PrometheusBundle;
import io.dropwizard.core.Application;

public class MyApplication extends Application<MyConfiguration> {
   
    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        new MyApplication().run(args);
    }

   @Override
   public void initialize(Bootstrap<MyConfiguration> bootstrap) {
      // ...
      bootstrap.addBundle(PrometheusBundle.builder().build());
      // ...
   }

   @Override
   public void run(MyConfiguration configuration, Environment environment) {
      // ...
   }
}
```
