# Kafka Example
This module presents two very basic example applications
 * one for showing the creation of [`MessageProducer`](./src/main/java/org/sdase/commons/server/kafka/KafkaExampleProducerApplication.java) and 
 * one for showing the creation of [`MessageListener`](./src/main/java/org/sdase/commons/server/kafka/KafkaExampleConsumerApplication.java). The consumers are very simple and just store the retrieved values in an list.  

Each of the applications comprise two examples, a simple one and a more complex one using values from the Kafka section of the application configuration.
