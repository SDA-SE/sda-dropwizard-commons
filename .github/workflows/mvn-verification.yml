      # This test is a simplified version of the dependency check performed by Maven Central on
      # release. As dependency resolution is different between Gradle and Maven, in some cases
      # everything is fine in Gradle and in dependent Gradle projects, although some dependency
      # versions can't be resolved in a Maven project and also fail the validation when releasing
      # to Maven Central.
