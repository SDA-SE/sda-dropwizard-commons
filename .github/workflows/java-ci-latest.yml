# This workflow builds + tests using the latest Java version
#
# Disclaimer:
# ----------
# This workflow is only used to get early feedback about the compatibility of the library. It still
# does not guarantee that services using this library will work in the given Java version.
#
# It was created by copying the 'official' java-ci.yml and applying the following changes:
# - only runs on `main`
# - only one `os` + `java_version` in the build matrix
# - not a complete checkout (with fetch-depth: 0)
# - only 3 retries
# - no release (step 'semantic-release')
# - no publication of the test results (step 'publish-test-results')
