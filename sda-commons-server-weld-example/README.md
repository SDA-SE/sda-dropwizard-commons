# Weld Example

This module shows an example how to start an [`application`](./src/main/java/org/sdase/commons/server/weld/WeldExampleApplication.java) 
with Weld support and how beans can be created and used.

The [test](./src/test/java/org/sdase/commons/server/weld/WeldExampleApplicationIT.java)
shows how to start such an application within an integration test.
