## Changelog and Versioning

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

See our [changelog](https://github.com/SDA-SE/sda-dropwizard-commons/releases/) for more information about the latest features.

> Please note that we will release smaller breaking changes more often. It does not mean that you will
be affected every time, but we want to live by the semantic versioning approach more seriously to 
make it more transparent if there is change that may have an effect on you. This also affects 
further maintenance of previous major releases. Not all of them will receive updates in the future.
