    The [sda-dropwizard-commons](https://github.com/SDA-SE/sda-dropwizard-commons) library
    includes several modules to speed up SDA-compliant microservice development. It is
    based on the [Dropwizard](https://www.dropwizard.io) framework, which offers a
    bundle mechanism for extensions. The bundles that are provided with _sda-dropwizard-commons_
    configure the framework with default SDA specific settings and add support for an easy and
    fast integration of standard technologies such as SQL, noSQL, or messaging frameworks.
