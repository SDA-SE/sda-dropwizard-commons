        Identifies the context in which an event happened. Often this will include information such as the type of the event source, the organization publishing the event or the process that produced the event. The exact syntax and semantics behind the data encoded in the URI is defined by the event producer.

        Producers MUST ensure that `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event.

        An application MAY assign a unique `source` to each distinct producer, which makes it easy to produce unique IDs since no other producer will have the same source. The application MAY use UUIDs, URNs, DNS authorities or an application-specific scheme to create unique source identifiers.

        A source MAY include more than one producer. In that case the producers MUST collaborate to ensure that `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event.

        **SDA**: Most importantly the source MUST identify the producer of your event uniquely. If you don't have any other guidelines defined by your company we recommend the following pattern:
        `/COMPANY/DOMAIN/SYSTEM/SERVICE`

        - `COMPANY`: An identifier of the company that is responsible for the service, e.g. `SDA-SE`
        - `DOMAIN`: The name of the business domain of the service, e.g. `consent`
        - `SYSTEM`: The name of the system of the service, e.g. `partner-consent-stack`

        This describes the subject of the event in the context of the event producer (identified by `source`). In publish-subscribe scenarios, a subscriber will typically subscribe to events emitted by a source, but the `source` identifier alone might not be sufficient as a qualifier for any specific event if the `source` context has internal sub-structure.

        Identifying the subject of the event in context metadata (opposed to only in the data payload) is particularly helpful in generic subscription filtering scenarios where middleware is unable to interpret the data content. In the above example, the subscriber might only be interested in blobs with names ending with '.jpg' or '.jpeg' and the subject attribute allows for constructing a simple and efficient string-suffix filter for that subset of events.""")

        Content type of data value. This attribute enables data to carry any type of content, whereby format and encoding might differ from that of the chosen event format. For example, an event rendered using the JSON envelope format might carry an XML payload in data, and the consumer is informed by this attribute being set to "application/xml". The rules for how data content is rendered for different `datacontenttype` values are defined in the event format specifications; for example, the JSON event format defines the relationship in section 3.1.

        For some binary mode protocol bindings, this field is directly mapped to the respective protocol's content-type metadata property. Normative rules for the binary mode and the content-type metadata mapping can be found in the respective protocol

        In some event formats the `datacontenttype` attribute MAY be omitted. For example, if a JSON format event has no `datacontenttype` attribute, then it is implied that the data is a JSON value conforming to the "application/json" media type. In other words: a JSON-format event with no `datacontenttype` is exactly equivalent to one with `datacontenttype="application/json"`.

        When translating an event message with no `datacontenttype` attribute to a different format or protocol binding, the target `datacontenttype` SHOULD be set explicitly to the implied `datacontenttype` of the source.
